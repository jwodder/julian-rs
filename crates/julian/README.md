`julian` is a Rust library for converting between [Julian day numbers][] and
dates in the [Gregorian calendar][] (either proleptic or with the Reformation
occurring at a given date) and/or the proleptic [Julian calendar][].  There are
also features for querying details about years & months in a "reforming"
Gregorian calendar and how they are affected by the calendar reformation date
of your choice.

Examples
========

Before you construct a date, you must first choose a calendar in which to
reckon dates.  `Calendar::GREGORIAN` is the proleptic Gregorian calendar, which
should be both simple and useful enough for most basic purposes.

To convert a Julian day number to a date in a calendar, use the
`Calendar::at_jdn()` method, like so:

```rust
use julian::{Calendar, Month};

let cal = Calendar::GREGORIAN;
let date = cal.at_jdn(2460065);
assert_eq!(date.year(), 2023);
assert_eq!(date.month(), Month::April);
assert_eq!(date.day(), 30);
```

So JDN 2460065 is April 30, 2023, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.

To convert a date to a Julian day number, use `Calendar::at_ymd()` to construct
the date, and then call its `julian_day_number()` method:

```rust
use julian::{Calendar, Month};

let cal = Calendar::GREGORIAN;
let date = cal.at_ymd(2023, Month::April, 30).unwrap();
assert_eq!(date.julian_day_number(), 2460065);
```

See [the documentation](https://docs.rs/julian) for more things you can do!

Command
=======

There is also an accompanying binary package
[`julian-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/julian-cli) that provides a CLI command
named `julian` for converting between Julian day numbers and dates in
Julian-style calendars.  Feel free to install it if you're interested!
