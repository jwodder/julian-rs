.TH JULIAN 1 2023-05-14
.SH NAME
julian \- Convert Julian day numbers to & from calendar dates
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B julian
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ "date ..." ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
When invoked without arguments, the
.B julian
command displays the current date in the proleptic Gregorian calendar & UTC
timezone along with the corresponding Julian day number.
.PP
When
.B julian
is invoked with one or more arguments,
any calendar date arguments (in the form "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-JJJ")
are converted to Julian day numbers,
and any integer arguments are treated as Julian day numbers
and converted to calendar dates.
By default, dates are read & written using the proleptic Gregorian calendar,
but this can be changed with the
.B \-\-julian
or
.B \-\-reformation
option.
.PP
.B julian
uses astronomical year numbering,
where 1 BC (the year immediately before AD 1) is denoted on input & output as year 0 (displayed as "0000"),
and the year before that (normally called 2 BC) is denoted -1 (displayed as "-0001").
In addition, the start of the year is always taken as being on January 1,
even though not all users of the Julian calendar throughout history have followed this convention.
